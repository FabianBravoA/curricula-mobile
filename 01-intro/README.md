# Your first Android app

[ :construction: Work in progress. Suggestions welcome. :construction: ]

This course is intended to be a _first experience_ in Android app development.

> Android provides a rich application framework that allows you to build
> innovative apps and games for mobile devices in a Java language environment

Android is hugely popular and in high demand. Browsing a few job placement
platforms we find that **Android Native** tags appear twice as often compared to
all non-native mobile technologies combined.

In this course you will be presented with the challenge of building a working
prototype for an Android app. A fictional (or even real) company wants to
prototype an idea for a new app, and you are given the task of learning some
Android basics and putting together a prototype they can use in a presentation
they will be giving at an upcoming conference.

This course heavily relies on amazing [free resources](#further-reading) that we
strongly recommend checking out if you are interested in Android development.

## Target audience

This course is aimed at our bootcamp graduates.

The course is being designed so that it can be run as part of our Continuous
Education program (4 weeks - 4 seminars and 4 webinars in 4 weeks).

## Previous knowledge / requirements

You are expected to be familiar with web development (`HTML`/`XML` and at least
one programming language - ie: `JavaScript`) although no specific previous
knowledge of Android or Java are required.

## Learning objectives

* Familiarise with Android dev tools
* Android App Fundamentals
* First experience designing/building an Android app
* Planning
* Continuous enhancement

## Product

Students will be given some graphics (a logo, font, colour scheme) along with a
project brief. The brief should include specifications for 2-3 _screens_
(activities) and students are expected to create a _mockup_ Android app (the app
doesn't need to be a fully fledged app) so that it can be installed and run on
Android devices. Alternatively you can pick an existing app and try to replicate
2-3 different _screens_.

Students will work in pairs, documenting their planning and progress on GitHub.

By the end of the course you should have produced a _working_ prototype that can
be installed and run on an Android device. It is very important that the
prototype _works_. This means that we expect you to pay special attention to
building in blocks thats allow you to have something ready to publish even if
you need to leave some features out (that can be added later).

The course will close with a demo day were each team will present their work and
share the learning experience with the rest of the group (and maybe guests as
well?).
